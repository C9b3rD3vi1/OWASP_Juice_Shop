## Open for Business

Within this room, we will look at OWASP's TOP 10 vulnerabilities in web applications. You will find these in all types of web applications. But for today we will be looking at OWASP's own creation, Juice Shop!


The FREE Burpsuite rooms 'Burpsuite Basics'  and 'Burpsuite Repeater'  are recommended before completing this room!

Juice Shop is a large application so we will not be covering every topic from the top 10.

We will, however, cover the following topics which we recommend you take a look at as you progress through this room.
